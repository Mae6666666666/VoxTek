                Sir Pentious! a man born in London roughly around 1830. He has a love for building gadgets that are deemed "outdated" by Baxter, and a true heart of an Angel. Sir Pentious was known as a hermit in his lifetime before he originally came to hell (now redeemed), not having any friends and preferring to watch as well as do his work. Although he seems cowardice at first, he makes the brave, ultimate sacrifice that ends up in his unfortunate death but fortunate redemption, now currently living in heaven. (HI RYAN <3 :D)
